<p>Sin is the <mark><strong>basic problem</strong></mark> in our world. It is why there is pain, suffering, and death. God didn’t create everything this way. He created everything <mark><strong>very good</strong></mark>, but we sinned against Him resulting in these problems. Sin has <mark><strong>separated</strong></mark> us from God and from one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graciously, He has taken steps to <mark><strong>solve our sin problem</strong></mark> to restore our relationship with Him and others. He did this by sending His own Son, Jesus Christ, who was without sin and could pay the penalty for our sin by <mark><strong>dying for us on the cross</strong></mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God was satisfied with Christ’s payment and raised Him <mark><strong>from the dead</strong></mark> so that when we believe in Him, God gives us His life. At that time, our relationship with God is restored and we have <mark><strong>eternal life</strong></mark>.</p>
