== Why Give?

If you have been blessed by the sound teaching of God’s word at Spokane Bible Church, you may want to respond to the Lord’s grace provision in your life by giving.

[quote,1 Corinthians 9:11]
"If we sowed spiritual things in you,
is it too much if we reap material things from you?”

'''

== How to Give?

When you give, consider what you would like to give,

and do not give grudgingly or under compulsion, but do so cheerfully!

[quote,2 Corinthians 9:7]
“Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart,
not grudgingly or under compulsion,
for god loves a cheerful giver.”
