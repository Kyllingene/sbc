Our Pastor-Teacher, Jeremy Thomas, graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. Following undergraduate studies he worked in the field of plant physiology for five years, specializing in genetic engineering. During this time he attended Tyndale Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. Afterward, he became pastor-teacher of Fredericksburg Bible Church for 15 years. During this time he also published articles in theological journals in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

He is currently Adjunct Faculty at Chafer Theological Seminary and Pastor-Teacher of Spokane Bible Church. His teachings are featured weekly on Grace Global Radio, a grace-oriented, dispensational broadcast ministry that focuses on equipping and edifying believers with sound bible doctrine. His extensive research, analysis of the original text and ancient history, joined with his conviction that the Word of God applies to every area of life, results in an enjoyable and approachable expository style. He and his wife, Robin, have five children and reside in Spokane, WA.
