= There is #Good News!#

* Sin is the #*basic problem*# in our world. It is why there is pain, suffering, and death. God didn’t create everything this way. He created everything #*very good*#, but we sinned against Him resulting in these problems. Sin has #*separated*# us from God and from one another.

* Graciously, He has taken steps to #*solve our sin problem*# to restore our relationship with Him and others. He did this by sending His own Son, Jesus Christ, who was without sin and could pay the penalty for our sin by #*dying for us on the cross*#.

* God was satisfied with Christ’s payment and raised Him #*from the dead*# so that when we believe in Him, God gives us His life. At that time, our relationship with God is restored and we have #*eternal life*#.
