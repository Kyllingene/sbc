= There is #Good News!#

* Sin is the #*basic problem*# in our world. It is why there is so much hurting, pain, and brokenness. God didn’t create everything this way. He created everything #*very good*#, yet we sinned against Him. Sin has #*separated*# us from Him and from one another.

* Graciously, He has taken steps to #*solve our sin problem*# to restore our relationship with Him and others. He did this by sending His own Son, Jesus Christ, who was without sin and could pay the penalty for our sin by dying for us on the cross.

* God was #*satisfied*# with His payment and raised Him from the dead so that He can give us His life. When we #*believe in Him*#, God gives us His life. At that time, our relationship with God is #*restored*# and we have eternal life.
